## Overview

This repository serves as a space where we work on various programming languages, frameworks, and real-life projects. It is organized into different sections for each skill or project we're focusing on.

## Learning Goals

Here are the key areas we are focusing on:

1. **Learn React**  
   - Building modern, scalable web applications using React.
   - Understanding React hooks, state management, and component lifecycle.

2. **Learn Java**  
   - Mastering object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.
   - Working with Spring Boot and other Java frameworks.

3. **Learn Go (Golang)**  
   - Exploring Go for building fast, efficient backend services.
   - Understanding concurrency and multi-threading in Go.

4. **Work on Real-Life Projects**  
   - Apply learned skills by working on real-world applications.
   - Gain experience in full-stack development and software deployment.

Each learning path will be documented with tasks and projects that reflect our progress.

## How to Contribute
